Capz AI: Aura-Link 🧠✨

Stop Taking Notes. Start Taking Insights.

Capz AI is an educational technology startup dedicated to removing the "interface" between students and learning. Our flagship product, the Aura-Link Node, is a screen-less wearable designed to help students stay 100% present in the classroom while an AI-powered "Second Brain" handles the heavy lifting of recording, transcribing, and visualizing complex concepts.

🚀 The Product: Aura-Link Node

The Aura-Link Node is a transparent, minimalist wearable that captures high-fidelity audio and uses Gemini 2.0 models to process lectures in real-time.

Key Innovations:

Voice-to-Diagram: Automatically converts verbal descriptions of processes into professional flowcharts and mind maps.

Google Workspace Native: Syncs directly to Google Docs, Drive, and Calendar—no new apps to learn.

AI Tutor: A context-aware assistant that knows exactly what was said in your specific lecture.

Screen-less Design: Promotes eye contact and engagement by removing the distraction of phones and laptops.
